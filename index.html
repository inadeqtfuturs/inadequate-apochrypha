					Hyperobjects:
					- viscous
					- non-local
					- interobjectivity
					- ex. black hole, Florida Everglades, plastic bags, pop culture
					- "Hyperobjects are not just collections, systems, or assemblages of other objects. They are objects in their own right" (Morton 2)
					- "...there is no center and we don't inhabit [the center]. Yet add to this is another twist: there is no edge!" (Morton 17)

					"What was it we said? That I needed to know what was inside the lighthouse. That moment's passed. It's inside me now. It's not like us. It's unlike us. I don't know what it wants. Or if it wants. But it will grow until it encompasses everything. Our bodies and our minds will be fragmented into their smallest parts until not one part remains" -Ventress

					Climate:
					- connectedness // multiplicity
					- "I can think and compute climate in this sense, but I can't directly see or touch it" (Morton 12)
					- "The very climates—-cognitive, industrial, economic, affective, technological, epistemological and meteorological—-that render our life possible are also self-destructive (both destructive of the self, and destructive of climate itself)" (Colebrook 11)
					- "At stake is not recognizing antiblackness as total climate" (Sharpe, *In the Wake* 21) // antiblackness as humanism

				<section data-markdown style="text-align:left">
					Anthropocene:
					- "The end of the world has already occurred" (Morton 7)
					- humans as a geological force (see: Crutzen (2000))
					- age of assymetry // time of hypocrisy (Morton 2, 6)
					- "Every decision we make is in some sense *related* to hyperobjects. These decisions are not limited to sentences in text about hyperobjects. When I turn the key in the ignition of my car, I am relating to global warming. When a novelist writes about emigration to Mars, he is writing about global warming" (Morton 20, emphasis added)

					Extinction Theory // Futurity:
					- "Today, we might start to question the appropriate point of view from which we might observe and evaluate the human viewing eye: from our own greater will to survive, or would it not be better to start to look at the world and ourselves without assuming our unquestioned right to life?" (Colebrook 22)
					- The question becomes "What do we do about/around/within extinction? For whom or what, and at what cost?" (echoing Haraway)

				<section data-markdown style="text-align:left">
					Flat Ontology:
					- no hierarchy of being
					- correlationism: "the notion that philosophy can only talk within a narrow bandwidth, restricted to the human-world correlate: meaning is only possible between a human mind and what it thinks, its 'objects,' flimsy and tenuous as they are" (Morton 9)
					- "our openness to the world...is precisely what seduces us into forgetting that before there is an eye that acts as a camera or window there must have been something like an orientation or distance, a relation without rela- tion" (Colebrook 13-14)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown style="text-align:left">
					Extinction Theory // Futurity (ii):
					- "I believe in the world and want to be in it. I want to be in it all the way to the end of it because I believe in another world in the world and I want to be in that. And I plan to stay a believer, like Curtis Mayfield. But that’s beyond me, and even beyond me and Stefano, and out into the world, the other thing, the other world, the joyful noise of the scattered, scatted eschaton, the undercommon refusal of the academy of misery" (Moten, *The Undercommons* 118)
